RAII (Release and is intialization)
SBRM (scope based resource management)


---------------RAII----------------->
constructor mein cheeze acquire kro or usko terminate ya release krna hai wo destructor mein kro



    A basic layout of smart pointer

                                            HEAP
                                     0x100H
                                    [    101  | Yuvraj | 80000.0f          ]
        STACK MEMORY
    [
            mptr
        [   0x100H      ]
        ....
        ....
        ....
    ]
    <-------------shared pointer---------------> 



static_cast (if we have to convert type a into type b where type b and type has no relation/ no heirarchy like inheritance or anything we can use static_cast)
We cannot change const using static_cast

static_assert (static assertion is used for compile time)
